Who I am?
I come from China,a beautiful country.
I'm just 13 years old,maybe my thinking is not only 13.
Because I'm a Chinese so my English is really bad.And because I'm learning Deutsch,so my English even worse than another child in China.But I will keep learning and make the dreams from me come ture(just say to me may be it will be not possible because I will not keep learning?):)
